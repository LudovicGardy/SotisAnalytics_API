## Backend API

### Overview
The backend of the web application is structured to support various functionalities, including database interactions and data processing. It is designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, aligning with the best practices in backend development.

### Key Components
- `main.py`: The heart of the backend, this Python file establishes the API endpoints, manages request handling, and integrates with databases. It ensures efficient data retrieval and manipulation, serving as a bridge between the frontend and the databases.
- `config.py`: This configuration file securely manages essential settings and parameters storend in environment variables, such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information required for the backend's operation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages and libraries required to run the backend smoothly. This includes frameworks and libraries for web development, data processing, and database connectivity.

### Technology Stack
- **Python**: The primary language used for backend development, known for its simplicity and robustness.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless connection with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data as required by the application.
- **Security and Scalability**: Emphasis on secure data handling and scalability to accommodate growing data and user base.

### Functionality
The backend is responsible for:
- Handling API requests from the frontend.
- Performing CRUD operations on the database.
- Processing and preparing data for frontend consumption.
- Ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.
